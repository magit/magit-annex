* master (unreleased)

** New features

- File action commands now support Dired buffers.  The file at point
  (or marked files) is used as the default for completion.

  Consider binding ~magit-annex-file-action-popup~ to a key in Dired
  buffers.  If you are using git-annex.el, you can bind the popup to
  ~@f~ like this:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key git-annex-dired-map "f" #'magit-annex-file-action-popup)
  #+end_src

- In ~magit-annex-list-mode~ buffers, file action commands now
  consider files selected by the region when choosing a default for
  completion.

- ~git annex undo~ is now exposed via ~magit-annex-undo-files~, a new
  command available in ~magit-annex-file-action-popup~.

** Interface changes

- ~magit-annex-list-popup~ now invokes the popup rather than the
  default action when called without a prefix.

  You can restore the previous behavior with

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq magit-annex-list-popup
        (plist-put magit-annex-list-popup :use-prefix 'popup))
  #+end_src

* 1.5.0

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 2.12.0 or later.

* 1.4.0

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 2.11.0 or later.

** Interface changes

- Starting with Magit 2.11.0, the commands ~magit-git-command~ and
  ~magit-git-command-topdir~ add "git " to the initial input rather
  than prepending it to the input after it is read.  This change
  enables arbitrary shell commands to be executed.  Similarly, the
  commands ~magit-annex-command~ and ~magit-annex-command-topdir~ now
  set the initial input to "git annex ".

** Miscellaneous

- The option ~magit-annex-standard-options~ has been renamed to
  ~magit-annex-global-arguments~ and marked as obsolete.

* 1.3.1

** New features

- The ~--no-commit~ switch and ~--jobs~ option have been added to

* 1.3.0

** New features

- The prompt for file actions now supports wildcards.

- The command ~magit-annex-unused~ now supports arguments through the
  new popup ~magit-annex-unused-popup~.  A new command
  ~magit-annex-unused-reflog~ has also been added to the popup.
  ~magit-annex-unused-popup~ has replaced ~magit-annex-unused-popup~
  in the top-level Magit-annex popup.

- The command ~magit-annex-list-files~ now supports the ~--allrepos~
  flag through the new popup ~magit-annex-list-popup~.  By default,
  ~@l~ calls ~magit-annex-list-files~ directly, but a prefix argument
  invokes the popup.

- New command ~magit-annex-list-dir-files~ has been added as an action
  in ~magit-annex-list-popup~.  This functionality was previously
  available when a prefix argument was given to
  ~magit-annex-list-files~.

** Interface changes

- The command ~magit-annex-unused-log~ has been replaced by
  ~magit-annex-unused-log-popup~, a command which calls
  ~magit-log-popup~ but sets the ~-S~ flag to the key of the unused
  file at point.  The new option ~magit-annex-unused-stat-argument~
  controls whether the flag ~--stat~ is also added.

- ~magit-annex-unused-sections-hook~ has been removed.

* 1.2.0

** New features

  to be confirmed by the user.
